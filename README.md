## Hi there 👋
I'm Chee Rei Tan (14 this year), a student hoping to become a software engineer!

- 🔭 I'm not working on anything at the moment, but I'm thinking of making an Android app later for fun!
- 🌱 I’m currently taking an online course called CS50x to learn the basics of computer science!
- ❤️ What I love about software development: being able to design cool and efficient software!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first language was C++!
